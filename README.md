# CoffeeShop
Simple CoffeeShop app designed with good OO principles and practices in mind and used to learn new frameworks and utilities.

This project was created in order to show a good example of project design, as well as a mode to continue learning about the Sprig Framework.

This project is still in development however the project in the current state still has some functionality.

The project takes advantage of the Swagger2 UI API, in conjunction with SpringBoot, and when running access to model "Orders" from the CoffeeShop
can be found in, modified, and tested using the link http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html# 

This will continue to be a base for myself to learn new tools and also a place to have simple examples to fall back on.
